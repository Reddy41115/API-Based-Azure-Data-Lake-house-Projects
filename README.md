Azure Synapse Analytics – External Tables

In this project, Azure Synapse Analytics (Serverless SQL Pool) is used to create external tables on data stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Gold layer).

The external tables allow querying data directly from ADLS without loading it into a database, making the solution cost-effective and scalable.
